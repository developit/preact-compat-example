[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/developit/preact-compat-example.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a demo showing [preact-compat] being leveraged to make use of [react-toolbox] library with [Preact] instead of React.

The React-based demo was 1.8mb of JavaScript. This demo, using exactly the same code and with the same functionality, is 60kb - or **14.3kb when gzipped**.
